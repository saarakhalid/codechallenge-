## project title
Bot Battlr

## Description
### Core Deliverables

- View profiles of all bots in the `BotCollection`.
- Add an individual bot to your army by clicking on it. The selected bot will render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only once.
- Release a bot from your army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the `YourBotArmy` component.
- Discharge a bot from service forever by clicking the red button marked "x", which will delete the bot both from the backend and from the `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.

### Advanced Deliverables

- Choose whether to enlist a bot into your army or just view its data. Clicking on the card will display a show view (`BotSpecs`) for that bot, replacing `BotCollection`. BotSpecs will have buttons to go back to the list view and to enlist that bot.
- Sort bots by their health, damage, or armor using the `SortBar`.
- Filter bots by their class using the `FilterBar`. Multiple filters can be selected simultaneously.
- Enlist only one bot from each `bot_class`. The available classes are: `["Support", "Medic", "Assault", "Defender", "Captain", "Witch"]`.
